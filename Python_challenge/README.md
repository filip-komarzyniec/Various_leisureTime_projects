### Programmes written while doing a Python course from the site _kodolamacz.pl_

* **Python-challenge#1.py**
	It's a simple 'tell me your name and I'll print it'. The programme takes name and surname as input and returns the greeting.

* **Python-challenge#2.py**
	This programme is a calculator. I wanted it to handle the order of operations (without brackets)  and wrote it using python iterators (I was learning them at that time). It basically works, unless you specify such operations:
    - division, multiplying and then again division ...
    - multiplying, division and then again multiplying...
    - if such operations are separated by adding or substracting it's all good. The point is not to write them one by one.
