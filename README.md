  A script automating scraping certain information from polish movie site - filmweb[dot]pl. It was developed as part of a bigger data science project which goal was to predict upcoming films' box office based on the historical data and various pieces of information such as cast, screenwriter, director etc. The script's main usage was to enrich the dataset.  
  Information gathered from filmweb are the following --- actors names, their ratings and number of votes that ratings were based upon. Also the number of awards granted to each actor is collected. The actors are traversed from the most popular ones (according to the site). All collected information is saved and exported to a csv file.
